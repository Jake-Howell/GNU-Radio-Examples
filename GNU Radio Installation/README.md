# GNU Radio Installaton

GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software defined radios.<br> 
It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment.<br> 
It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.
