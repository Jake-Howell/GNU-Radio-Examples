# Vector Source Block

[Source: GNU-Radio - Vector Source Page](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Vector_Source)
<br>
The Vector Source Block allows the user to create a stream of samples based on an input vector.<br>
The data can repeat infinitely until the flowgraph is terminated by some other event or, the default, run the data once and stop. <br>
The vector source block can also produce stream tags with the data.<br>
These tags can help identify the start of a repeating signal when viewing the output in a GUI Sink (eg. GUI Time Sink).
